### Feedback: Day 1
## What did you learn from this session that was interesting or useful? 
- The use of a concept map to design lessons!
- Different types of misconceptions; summative vs formative assessment differences between novices and competent users
- Best practices for instructor/learner interactions and some tools for concept management
- Use of Concept Maps to inform lesson/instructional design.
- memory length, concept map
- 7+-2 memory
- First, thank you!  Wonderful session.  I appreciated the clarity on going slow and the target audience for Carpentries.  I've been involved and know that novice is the target, but it was very helpful to have this reinforced.
- Cognitive Development and Mental models, identiying misconceptions, expert awareness gap
- The importance of avoiding demotivational language, and how you can use it without meaning to if you're not careful mental models and concept maps
- I liked the discussion of demotivational language and ways we can avoid it. 

## What information from this session is still confusing or unclear? 
- How to best develop some familiarity with learners to help the room loosen up
- Still struggling to translate a mental model to a concept map/differentiate the two
- concept mapping relationships are still a little unclear
- How to apply the new tools to some real workshop topics
- How to more completely build Concept Maps.  New activity, working on the nodes/connections in my brain. 
- concept map 
- Tools for concept map
- I will be the one who remains a bit unclear on the concept map :).  I think for me I have not found this tool to be very useful and maybe I just have a mental hangup with it.  I usually think in outline form.  I wonder if some topics (e.g., changing oil or recipes) are more linear and better suited to outlines, whereas other topics that don't have a clear start and end are better suited for maps.
- Al clear
- I understand the purpose of a concept map, but it's still unclear how we go about creating them (i.e. what are some good strategies for approaching the issue)
- None
- I understand the concept of concept maps, but I struggled creating my own. It seemed like it should have been easier than it was. 

## What aspects of the presentation worked well?
- All of the visuals were fantastic!
- Engaging conversation and energy, Etherpad is a useful spot for collecting communal notes
- Zoom is a good platform for this. Seeing everyone's faces is good.
- Learner input via Etherpad
- Everything.   Love it.  Both Christina and Kari both present well and the content is well-designed. 
- interactive . also break room
- Interactivity
- This is my first online class of any kind and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.  You have kept things simple and everything has worked technically, which is not trivial.  
- I liked the presentation structure of the morning workshop
- The combination of text and voice/video feedback gives multiple options for people who are more (or less) comfortable with certain methods
- The slides, etherpad, questions asked by asking people directly, examples given to explain a concept, breakout rooms
- Kari is great to listen to! I like your stories and tangents! 

## Name one thing that would make the presentation more effective. 
- Maybe a concept map concept map isn't the best first concept map to show people who don't know what a concept map is ;)
- A bit more breakout group activity and discussion
- More seamless interactivity through things like polls might be nice.
- Seeing the notes/thoughts others have had or shared about topics we've discussed be captured somehow could be enriching (for those who want to see that stuff)
- Less a matter of the presentation but more a matter of the tools/platform being used and norms and/or expectation for use there of.  Raising hands vs just un-muting for responding verbally.  Issues with Zoom/Etherpad.  Hard to handle in the moment, both presenters did so nicely.
- little breaks every hour
- Presentation Material
- My only (very minor) issue was not being able to find some space on the etherpad without typing over someone.  I wonder if for the exercises if you had everyone's names already populated this would help somewhat.  But, again, obviously not a huge issue.
- nothing toad here
- If you click the "join breakout room" immediately, you miss out on whatever the instructor was saying once you click the button, so it would be helpful to explain that, or have clear written instructions on the task to be performed/discussed/etc. in the Etherpad. This was a bit confusing in the first breakout session.
- None, it is well done.
- Nothing that I can think of!
